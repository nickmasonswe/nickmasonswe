<h3> Software Engineer Using the Right Tool for the Job | See Patterns, Solve Problems</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p>
I set myself apart with my ability to quickly learn new languages, frameworks, and technologies due to a deep understanding of the transferable knowledge and recurring patterns that underpin these tools. This skill allows me to get up to speed and confidently adapt to evolving demands.
  </p>
  <p></p>
As an empathetic software engineer, I am passionate about collaborating with cross-functional teams to translate complex ideas into user-friendly products that are highly maintainable, well-documented, and scalable.
